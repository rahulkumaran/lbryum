## [3.2.2] - 2018-06-19
### Fixed
 * `getnameclaims` raising an error when a signing certificate used in one of the claims has been abandoned (https://github.com/lbryio/lbryum/issues/193)
 * `importcertificateinfo` not writing to the wallet file immediately (fixes https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/issues/1231)


## [3.2.1] - 2018-03-28
### Fixed
 * Fixed a callback that was raising KeyError while parsing address history from server, which could potentially hang the network thread.

### Changed
 * Transaction fee now takes into consideration claims the same as lbrycrd patch https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd/pull/95
 * Extracted timeout to a constant, raised its value and fixed it to check if the server is responsive before disconnecting


## [3.2.0] - 2018-03-20
### Security
 * Stop allowing CORS for the JSON-RPC server (applies to lbryum daemon). See [electrum/issues/3374](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3374)

### Fixed
 * Use lock when performing WalletStorage.write()
 * Fixed `sendclaimtoaddress` for signed content claims
 * Fixed `https://github.com/lbryio/lbryum/issues/188`
 * Fixed main account not being created by `restore`
 * Fixed claim result from `getcertificatesforsigning` with only the `is_mine` field being returned for claims that aren't yet returned by `getclaimsbyids`. This caused bugs when making claims with channels that were not yet confirmed (https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/issues/1037).

### Changed
 * Bumped `lbryschema` requirement to 0.0.15 [see changelog](https://github.com/lbryio/lbryschema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0015---2018-03-20)

 * Moved storage.write call in `getunusedaddress` to `Deterministic_Wallet`
 * By default use the least used change address rather than generating new ones for claims.
 * Only consider addresses with less than 100 utxos for re-use.
 * Set the blockchain to use in lbryschema when it is set in lbryum
 * Use separate headers files for different chains, the default `blockchain_headers` for lbrycrd_main is unchanged. Regtest headers are saved to `regtest_headers`, and testnet to `testnet_headers`.
 * Reworked `payto`, `paytoandsend`, `paytomany`, `paytomanyandsend` into single `payto` command
 * Tip information is now always returned in `claimhistory` command
 * Information about abandoned claim/update/support is now returned in `claimhistory` command
 * Changed `offline_parse_and_validate_claim_result` and `parse_and_validate_claim_result` to include a permanent URL to claim and/or certificate.
